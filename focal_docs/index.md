# Focal Frontend Documentation

## Motivation:

The reason for this documentation is to enhance the maintainability and upgradabilty of the app by detailing the motivations behind design/architectural decisions and set and track goals for future iterations. The documentation only corresponds to the frontend of the application and only refers to the backend as it applies to interfacing between the two, as both systems are maintained seperately in different runtime environments and supported by seperate infrastructure. If you would like to contribute to the documentation or the software itself please feel free to reach out to me via email or by leaving a comment on the repo. All corrections are appreciated and encoutraged.
