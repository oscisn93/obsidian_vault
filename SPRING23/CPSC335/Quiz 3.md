# Single-source Shortest Path
Problems involving finding the minimum-weighted paths between vertices in weighted graphs. Weights are numerical cost values associated with edges. In single source shortest path problems, we are asked to calculate paths originating from source vertices.

```
G(V, E)
w: E -> R
weight function maps edges to weights in the real numbers
```
## Variants
**Single-Destination**
Finding the shortest path from every vertex to a destination. Basically an inversion of the single source and can be solved as such.
**Single-pair**
