Public statement from Obama, "We need to narrow the scope, not something wide scope". NSA self-described policy that "we only see numbers". Due to the secret nature of the NSA many programs that violated citizen's constitutional rights were kept secret, and were exposed by a contractor named Edward Snowden. Legally Edward Snowden's actions were highly unethical however did he actually do anything wrong? In order to truly answer the question we must analyze the situation from multiple ethical frameworks and weigh the  findings against our own moral frameworks.
