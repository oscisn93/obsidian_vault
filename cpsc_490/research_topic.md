Advancements in digital governance, specifically surveillance systems and the use of AI in order to aide and enhance the systems deployed by governments in order to enforce policy and control the flow of information in order to detect law breaking and other activities with a particular focus on the current capabilities and limitations of these systems.

The application of artificial intelligence to government surveillance systems has the capacity to not only change the way we think about and interact with the legal system, but also to completely change the way computer scientists think about their creations and the ethics of creating systems which, though they may present promising opportunities to advance, present just as much danger of being abused and used for harm. As such, I believe that innovations in this subfield have the capacity to create the biggest impact on the field of computer science because it will force us to either have a difficult conversation or about the ethics of using our skills for things that have the capcaity to do so much harm, or force us to face the cosequences of our technology being used to harm hundreds, thousands, or mybe even millions or billions of people.
