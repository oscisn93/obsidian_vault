Abstract

There is no shortage of Javascript libraries and tools, and that is not necessarily because these tools are great but because with every iteration developers find new ways in which they are lacking and/or in need of additional features or simply too slow. But what if there was a way to make highly optimized tools for web developers that could not only replace the existing ones but also address the problems with them and make it so that the likelihood of creating new ones is next to none? That is where tools developed in Rust come into the picture. Rust is both a low-level language that runs at speeds comparable to C, and yet has the high level abstractions necessary to compete make developing tools for the web sufficiently feasible to people not named Ken Thompson. Two examples that are available right now are Turbopack by Vercel and Deno. As we will see these tools are notwhere near complete, but their development is already causing waves and their performance is already superceding their non-Rust counterparts in many ways.
