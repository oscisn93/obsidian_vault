Notes:

This assignment is to be completed individually (no group/team).
Submissions outside Canvas is not accepted. Canvas is set up to only accept .zip file.

You should click on your submission file after it is submitted in Canvas to verify that it is not corrupted, is readable, can be opened, and contains the correct files for this assignment, and resubmit if necessary. Give yourself plenty of time to accomplish this. Running out of time, submitting incorrect file(s), or corrupted file(s) will be treated the same as No Submission.

Manage your submission File Size by controlling your Wireshark captures, and check the zip file size before submitting. Do not exceed 10 Megabytes. A penalty of 10% will be deducted for each 10 MB violation in excess from the allowed 10 MB. For example penalty for a 10.1 MB to 20 MB submission is 10%, and for a 20.1 MB to 30 MB submission the penalty is 20%. Limit your Wireshark capture file size by starting and stopping the capture process accordingly. Do not let your Wireshark run continuously without stopping. This will create a very large capture file and unnecessary penalty.

According to the class syllabus you have 24 hours grace period after the due date/time to submit with a 10% late penalty. Pay attention to the due date/time shown in Canvas. Canvas will not accept any submission after the closing date/time.

You are required to use Wireshark 3.4.8 or newer for this assignment. A penalty of 10% will apply if using older version.
